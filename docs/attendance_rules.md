2. If attendance falls below 65%, the student will receive a warning.
3. If attendance is between 65% and 75%, the student must attend maximum upcoming classes to become eligible.
4. Students with attendance below 75% may not be allowed to sit for the semester-end exam, unless special permission is granted.
