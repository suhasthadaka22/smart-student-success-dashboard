# Study Tips for Weak Subjects

1. Identify the subjects and topics where your marks are consistently low.
2. Revise lecture notes within 24 hours of the class.
3. Use spaced repetition: study small chunks every day instead of cramming.
4. Practice previous year question papers and assignments.
5. For DBMS, focus on:
   - ER diagrams and mapping
   - Normalization (1NF, 2NF, 3NF, BCNF)
   - SQL queries and joins
6. For OS, focus on:
   - Process management and CPU scheduling algorithms
   - Deadlocks and synchronization
7. For DSA, focus on:
   - Arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues
